Battleship game

1. To use Vue, I needed node > 18 and I was using 16.4.
   => Installed NVM for windows https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows?tab=readme-ov-file
   => Using 20.10.0 (current LTS) now

2. Trying out Vue. Started with `npm create vue@latest`
   => Skipped Pinia + Vitest + E2E framework options for this small project
   => Accepted Typescript, JSX, ESLint and Prettier
